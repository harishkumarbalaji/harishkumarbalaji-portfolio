    "content": [
      "My journey began in Electronics and Communication Engineering, but I was quickly drawn into robotics and autonomous systems through the sheer joy of solving complex real-world problems. What started with basic embedded systems soon expanded into full-stack robotics software, simulation frameworks, and eventually autonomous vehicle development. Each step revealed new layers of complexity and possibility in the world of robotics.",
      "Here's what drives me: I'm incredibly passionate about bridging the gap between simulation and reality. I'm constantly asking questions like <em>'How can we make robots more reliable and efficient?'</em> and <em>'What's the best way to validate autonomous systems before deployment?'</em> This relentless curiosity has led me to work on everything from low-level C++ systems to high-level perception algorithms.",
      "My day-to-day work blends low-level systems programming (C++, ROS/ROS2, Yocto) with higher-level autonomy and perception (Gazebo/CARLA simulation, Autoware, YOLO, NVBlox/ZED pipelines), plus CI-driven SIL/HIL testing and cloud/dockerized deployment. I enjoy the full feedback loop — designing behaviors and tools in simulation, bringing them to hardware, and iterating quickly from field data.",
      "Whether it's developing a high-fidelity robot simulation or implementing path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles, I believe the best robotic solutions emerge when technical excellence meets genuine curiosity about what's possible in the world of autonomy.",
      "<strong>Ready to explore what we can build together in robotics and autonomy?</strong>"
